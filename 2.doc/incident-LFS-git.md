# INCIDENT Large File System into git

## abstract:
A wal file has been added to the repo. This type of file is a database backup.
This is a common issue solution is known. 

##Â ITSM flow
### how should it be avoided?
Generally speaking it is best to have a pre-built .gitignore file. This file is used to ignore files that are not needed to commit. But in particular case it is hard to identify the culprit of large files.
Another best practice is to commit files 1 by 1.

### blocking
The target git repository is not accepting large files due to unknown reasons. (this is not normal in 2022 but hey ok...)

### rootcause
the development of an app led to unforseen consequences. A goldfish had a hiccup.

### cascading stuff
Because of the nature of git to track files delta, it is not possible to just delete the file. Git history has to be ammended (modified). All references to the file must be removed from the git tree history.

### actions
unprotect all the branches
build a bfg tool
cleaned repo with the tool
write documentation && update tool documentation
force push stuff
2h later it should be done

### agent
git owner > force pushed on main branch
